React.js is a JavaScript library used for building UI (User Interfaces). It was created and is maintained by Facebook. Its purpose is to create fast and interactive web applications. React primarily focuses on a component-based architecture, which makes the code modular and reusable.

Features of React.js:
Component-based Architecture:
In React, the UI is divided into small components that are independent and reusable. For example, a button, a navbar, or a card can each be a separate component.

Virtual DOM:
React doesn’t work directly with the actual DOM. Instead, it uses a Virtual DOM, which is a lightweight copy of the browser’s actual DOM. It detects changes quickly and updates only the necessary parts, making performance faster.

Declarative Approach:
In React, you just define how the UI should look, and React automatically updates it when the data changes.

JSX (JavaScript XML):
This is a syntax that allows you to write HTML within JavaScript. Example:

const element = <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;


React Hooks:
Hooks are used within functional components to manage state and lifecycle methods. Examples include useState and useEffect.


How React Works:
You create components that combine HTML and JavaScript.
These components render themselves based on data (props or state).
Whenever the data updates, React uses the Virtual DOM to make only the necessary changes.


Why Use React?
It’s fast and efficient (thanks to the Virtual DOM).
Reusable components make the code clean and manageable.
It’s perfect for building large-scale applications.
