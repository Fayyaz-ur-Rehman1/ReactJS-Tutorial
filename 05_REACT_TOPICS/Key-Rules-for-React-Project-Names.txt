When you provide a project name with create-react-app, there are certain restrictions for the name. While there’s no strict character limit, the following conditions must be followed:

Key Rules for React Project Names:
Valid NPM Package Name:
The project name must be a valid npm package name, as React apps internally rely on npm dependencies.

Length Recommendation:
Technically, there’s no strict character limit for npm package names, but an extremely long name isn’t practical. A reasonable maximum is around 214 characters, as this aligns with limitations of tar (a Unix archiving tool).

Allowed Characters:

Only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens (-), and underscores (_) are allowed.
Spaces, uppercase letters, and special characters (like @, $, %) are not allowed.
Name Should Not Conflict:
Your project name must not conflict with an existing npm package name.

Example:
Valid project names:

my-react-app
project_123
hello-world
Invalid project names:

MyReactApp (uppercase letters are not allowed)
react app (spaces are not allowed)
hello@world (special character @ is not allowed)
Conclusion:
Practically, a React project name can have up to 214 characters, but it’s better to keep it short, simple, and meaningful for better readability and maintenance.
