Babel is a JavaScript compiler that helps convert modern JavaScript (ES6+ and beyond) code into backward-compatible versions that older browsers can understand. In the context of React, Babel is commonly used to transpile JSX (JavaScript XML) into plain JavaScript. JSX is a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, and Babel ensures this is converted to standard JavaScript that browsers can execute.

For example:
If you write this JSX code:

jsx
Copy code
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
Babel converts it into:

javascript
Copy code
const element = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, world!');
This allows developers to use modern features and syntax while ensuring compatibility with different environments.
